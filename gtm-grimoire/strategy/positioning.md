# Product Positioning

## Executive Summary

Loa Constructs is positioned as the first **skill pack registry for Claude Code**—pre-built, production-ready agent workflows that extend AI coding assistants beyond code into GTM, documentation, and strategy. We're creating a new category ("AI Agent Skill Packs") rather than competing in crowded AI coding tool or prompt marketplace categories. This positions us uniquely against both infrastructure-focused MCP servers and commodity prompt marketplaces.

## Positioning Statement

> For **technical founders and developers using Claude Code**
> Who **need to move fast but lack time or expertise for non-code tasks like GTM, documentation, and deployment**
> Our **Loa Constructs** is a **skill pack registry**
> That **extends Claude Code with expert-designed, multi-step agent workflows—one command to install**
> Unlike **MCP servers (infrastructure-focused), prompt marketplaces (single prompts), or AI coding tools (code-only)**
> Our product **delivers complete methodologies with feedback loops, quality gates, and managed scaffolding that handle the "other 50%" of shipping products**

## Category Strategy

**Approach**: **Create New Category**

**Category Name**: AI Agent Skill Packs

**Rationale**:

1. **No direct competitor** exists for Claude Code-specific skill packs with subscription model [Reference: gtm-grimoire/research/competitive-analysis.md]

2. **Differentiated from adjacent categories**:
   - Not a prompt marketplace (we're multi-step workflows, not single prompts)
   - Not an MCP server (we're workflow-focused, not infrastructure)
   - Not an AI IDE (we extend Claude Code, not replace it)
   - Not a code assistant (we handle non-code tasks)

3. **First-mover advantage** in Claude ecosystem, which has 41% developer usage and 30M+ MAU [Reference: gtm-grimoire/research/market-landscape.md]

4. **Defensible positioning** through creator ecosystem (70% revenue share) and managed scaffolding architecture

**Category Definition**:
> An AI Agent Skill Pack is a pre-built, production-ready workflow that gives your AI coding assistant expert capabilities in a specific domain. Install with one command, run with slash commands, iterate with feedback loops.

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. MCP Marketplaces (mcp.so, mcpcat.io)

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Workflows vs. Infrastructure**: MCP servers are tools (databases, APIs); we're methodologies (complete GTM workflow)
- **Quality Curation**: We review and curate; MCP directories list everything
- **Business Model**: Sustainable subscription vs. free-for-all

**Why We Win**: MCP is the "how to connect"; Loa is the "what to do". You need both, but workflow value sits on top.

**Battlecard Response**: "MCP servers give Claude Code access to tools. We give it expertise. They're complementary—we use MCP under the hood."

---

### vs. Cursor Rules/Directories

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Platform**: Claude Code native vs. Cursor-only
- **Depth**: Multi-step workflows with feedback loops vs. single instruction files
- **Scope**: Non-code skills (GTM, docs) vs. code assistance only

**Why We Win**: Different platform (Claude vs. Cursor), different depth (workflows vs. rules), different scope (beyond code).

**Battlecard Response**: "If you're a Cursor user, great—use Cursor rules. If you're on Claude Code and need more than code completion, that's us."

---

### vs. PromptBase & Prompt Marketplaces

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Workflows vs. Prompts**: Complete multi-step methodologies vs. single prompts
- **IDE Integration**: CLI install directly into Claude Code vs. copy-paste
- **Subscription**: Recurring access vs. per-prompt purchase
- **Specialization**: Claude Code native vs. platform-agnostic

**Why We Win**: They sell prompts; we sell systems. They're $5 one-time; we're $29/mo for unlimited access to entire methodology.

**Battlecard Response**: "Prompts are the 'what to say'. Skills are the 'how to work'. We're multi-step workflows with memory, feedback loops, and quality gates."

---

### vs. GitHub Copilot / AI Coding Tools

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Scope**: Beyond code (GTM, docs, security, deployment) vs. code-only
- **Approach**: Complete methodologies vs. line-by-line completion
- **Extension Model**: Skill packs vs. proprietary extensions

**Why We Win**: They're excellent at code completion. We handle everything else founders need to ship.

**Battlecard Response**: "Copilot writes code. We handle the other 50%—GTM strategy, documentation, security audits, deployment. Use both."

---

### vs. "Do It Yourself" (Custom Prompts/Workflows)

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Time to Value**: Instant install vs. hours/days building
- **Expertise**: Expert-designed vs. trial-and-error
- **Maintenance**: Managed updates vs. self-maintained
- **Quality**: Tested with feedback loops vs. unknown quality

**Why We Win**: You could build your own GTM workflow, but it took us months. One command gives you that expertise.

**Battlecard Response**: "You can build custom workflows. We did too—and packaged them. One command, instant expertise. Focus on what's unique to your product."

---

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"$29/mo is too expensive"** | That's less than one hour of consultant time. If GTM Collective saves you 4+ hours on launch strategy, it's paid for itself in month one. Most AI tools are $10-20/mo for code completion—we're $29 for complete business workflows. |
| **"I can build my own workflows"** | Absolutely. We did too. But it took months of iteration. You can install ours in 60 seconds and get back to building your product. Or use our architecture to build your own—we're extensible. |
| **"What if Anthropic launches their own marketplace?"** | They might. We'll have established creator relationships, a curated ecosystem, and domain expertise by then. We'd be a natural acquisition or premium layer. Platform risk exists, but first-mover advantage matters. |
| **"I only need code help, not GTM"** | Then use the free tier for basic packs. When you're ready to ship and need positioning, pricing, or launch strategy, upgrade. We're for founders who ship products, not just write code. |
| **"This seems niche (Claude Code only)"** | Claude has 41% developer usage and 30M+ monthly active users. That's not niche—that's a massive, fast-growing market. We're focused, not limited. |
| **"How is this different from a prompt marketplace?"** | Prompts are one sentence. Skills are complete methodologies—multi-step workflows with memory, feedback loops, and quality gates. It's the difference between a recipe ingredient and a complete meal prep service. |
| **"What if the quality isn't good?"** | Every pack is reviewed before publishing. We're not a free-for-all—we curate. Plus subscription means ongoing relationship: if quality drops, you cancel. We're incentivized to maintain quality. |

## Messaging Don'ts

- **Don't say**: "AI-powered" (meaningless), "revolutionary" (overused), "best-in-class" (unsubstantiated)
- **Don't say**: "For everyone" (we're specifically for Claude Code users)
- **Don't say**: "Prompts" when describing our product (we're workflows/skills)
- **Don't say**: "No-code" (our users code, we're beyond-code)
- **Don't compare to**: ChatGPT, general AI assistants (we're specifically Claude Code tooling)
- **Don't compare to**: Enterprise workflow automation (Zapier, Make) (different category)
- **Avoid**: Marketing jargon developers hate ("synergy", "leverage", "unlock potential")
- **Avoid**: Overpromising ("replace your team", "build anything")
