## Page Header

### Headline
```
About Loa
```

### Subheadline
```
Built by developers who got tired of prompt engineering.
```

---

## Origin Story Section

### Headline
```
Why we built this
```

### Body
```
We've been using Claude Code since day one.

It's incredible for coding. But every time we needed to do
something non-code—GTM planning, security audits, deployment
docs—we'd spend hours crafting prompts and managing workflows.

The prompts got longer. The instructions got messier.
We were building the same workflows over and over.

So we packaged them up.

Loa Registry is a package manager for Claude Code skills.
The workflows we use daily, now available to everyone.

No more prompt engineering. Just install and ship.

## What is Loa Section

### Headline
```
What is Loa?
```

### Body
```
In Haitian Vodou, a Loa is a spirit that serves as an
intermediary between humans and the creator.

We liked the metaphor: AI agents that serve as intermediaries
between developers and complex workflows.

Plus, it's three letters. Easy to type.

## Team Section

### Headline
```
Who we are
```

### Body
```
Loa is built by The Honey Jar, a small team of developers
and founders who ship products.

We're not a VC-backed startup. We're bootstrapped builders
who make tools we actually use.

That means:
• No growth-at-all-costs mentality
• No dark patterns to juice metrics
• No selling your data
• Just useful tools at fair prices

## Philosophy Section

### Headline
```
What we believe
```

### Beliefs List

```
Developers deserve better tools.
Not more tools. Better ones.
Ones that respect your time and intelligence.

AI should augment, not replace.
Claude Code is powerful because YOU direct it.
Skills make that direction easier.

Simple beats complex.
One command to install. No config files.
No 47-step setup wizards.

Honest pricing beats growth hacks.
$29/month. No "contact sales" games.
No usage-based gotchas.

Open when possible.
Core framework is open source.
Premium packs fund development.
```
