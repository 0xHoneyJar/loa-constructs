## Problem Section

### Headline
```
You're building the prompts instead of the product.
```

### Body Copy
```
Every Claude Code user hits the same wall:

- Writing multi-step prompts from scratch
- Copy-pasting workflows between projects
- No version control for agent instructions
- Coding assistant that can't help with GTM, docs, or deployment

You didn't sign up to be a prompt engineer.
```

---

## Solution Section

### Headline
```
Agent skills that just work.
```

### Body Copy
```
Loa Registry is a package manager for Claude Code skills.

Install a pack → get production-ready workflows → ship.

No prompt engineering. No configuration. No bullshit.
```

### Feature List

**1. One-command install**
```bash
npx loa-registry pack-install <pack-name>
```
Skills appear in your project immediately.

**2. Beyond code completion**
```
Skills for the entire product lifecycle:
- Requirements → /plan-and-analyze
- Architecture → /architect
- Implementation → /implement sprint-1
- Security audit → /audit
- Deployment → /deploy-production
```

**3. Managed scaffolding**
```
Skills stay in sync. Updates don't break your setup.
Framework handles the complexity.
```
