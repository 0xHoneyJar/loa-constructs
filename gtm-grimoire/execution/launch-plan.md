# Launch Plan

## Executive Summary

Loa Constructs launches as a **soft launch** in January 2026 with a community-first, content-driven approach. Given bootstrapped constraints ($0-1K budget, small team), we prioritize organic channels where our primary ICPs (indie hackers, startup CTOs) already spend time: Twitter/X, Hacker News, Indie Hackers, and Product Hunt. The launch goal is 100+ registered users and 10+ paid Pro subscribers to validate product-market fit.

## Launch Type

**Selected**: **Soft Launch** (community-driven, rolling engagement)

**Rationale**:
1. **Budget constraints**: $0-1K marketing budget requires organic tactics [Reference: gtm-grimoire/context/product-brief.md#Constraints]
2. **Small team**: 1-3 people can't sustain big-bang launch coordination
3. **Community-first fit**: Primary ICPs (indie hackers) trust peer recommendations over marketing [Reference: gtm-grimoire/research/icp-profiles.md#Solo-Builder-Sam]
4. **Validation focus**: Need to validate PMF before scaling spend
5. **Iterate quickly**: Soft launch allows rapid feedback incorporation

**What this means**:
- No press embargo or coordinated blast
- Rolling content over 2 weeks vs. single day
- Community engagement > announcements
- Product Hunt as anchor event (not only event)

1. **User Acquisition**: 100+ registered users in first 30 days

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Low HN traction** | Medium | Medium | Focus on problem, not product; respond fast | Pivot to other channels (Reddit, IH) |
| **Product Hunt flop** | Medium | Low | Solid asset prep; launch Friday | It's one channel; focus elsewhere |
| **Technical issues on launch** | Low | High | Pre-launch testing; status page ready | Honest communication; quick fixes |
| **Negative feedback** | Medium | Medium | Listen, respond constructively | Iterate quickly; thank critics |
| **Zero conversions** | Low | High | Free tier validates interest first | Adjust pricing; gather feedback |
| **Creator burnout** | Medium | Medium | Schedule content ahead | Reduce posting frequency vs. quality |

### Contingency Plans

**If HN post flops** (<10 points):
- Analyze why (timing? framing? competition?)
- Post again next week with adjusted angle
- Focus energy on other channels

**If Product Hunt doesn't rank**:
- Still valuable for backlinks and discoverability
- PH is long-tail; traffic continues after launch day
- Focus on Twitter/IH for primary traction

**If signups but no conversions**:
- Survey free users: What's missing? Price concern?
- Consider limited-time discount to test elasticity
- Add more value demonstration before paywall
