# Melange Protocol v0.8 — Archived

> **ARCHIVED**: Melange protocol was removed in Phase 2 (2026-02-09).
> See `grimoires/loa/context/prd-constructs-network-phase2-v0.3.0.md` §2 for rationale.
> This directory preserves the protocol artifacts for historical context.

## Why Removed

Melange (GitHub Issues-based peer messaging) was designed but never operationalized.
`/send`, `/inbox`, `/threads` commands were never implemented.

## Replacement

- Peer messaging: GitHub Issues with structured labels (already working)
- Upstream learning: PR-based adoption pipeline (continuing to build)
