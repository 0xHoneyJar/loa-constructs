# Analyzing Gaps

Compare user expectations captured in UTCs and journeys with actual code behavior documented in reality files. Generate structured gap reports with severity classification, JTBD impact mapping, and resolution recommendations.

---

## Trigger

```
/analyze-gap {journey-id}
/analyze-gap {journey-id} --reality {component}
/analyze-gap {journey-id} --severity-threshold {level}
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/analyze-gap reward-understanding
/analyze-gap reward-understanding --reality use-recipe-deposit-flow
/analyze-gap informed-decision --severity-threshold high
```

---

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `journey-id` | Yes | Journey identifier to analyze |
| `--reality {component}` | No | Specific reality file to compare (otherwise uses journey's linked reality) |
| `--severity-threshold {level}` | No | Filter output to show only gaps at or above this severity |
| `--update-canvases` | No | Automatically update source canvas expectation gap tables |

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Load Journey Context

1. Read journey file from `grimoires/observer/journeys/{journey-id}.md`
2. Extract:
   - Journey steps (trigger, action, expected, potential errors)
   - Source canvases list
   - Success condition
   - Known gaps table

### Phase 2: Load User Truth (UTCs)

For each canvas in `source_canvases`:

1. Read canvas from `grimoires/observer/canvas/{username}.md`
2. Extract:
   - Qualitative evidence (quotes)
   - JTBD (primary and secondary)
   - Expectation gap table
   - Learning status

Aggregate user expectations:
- Compile all quotes related to journey
- Map quotes to journey steps
- Identify JTBD patterns across users

### Phase 3: Load Code Reality

1. Find reality file:
   - Use `--reality {component}` if provided
   - Otherwise check journey's `reality_file` metadata
   - Otherwise search `grimoires/observer/reality/` for matches

2. Read reality file and extract:
   - States and their triggers
   - UI feedback messages
   - Error handling patterns
   - File:line evidence

### Phase 4: Step-by-Step Comparison

For each journey step:

**User Expects** (from journey + canvases):
- Expected behavior from journey step
- Related quotes from UTCs
- Implicit expectations from JTBD

**Code Does** (from reality file):
- Actual state/behavior at this step
- UI feedback provided
- Error handling in place

**Identify Gap**:
- Expectation vs implementation mismatch
- Missing functionality
- Confusing or insufficient feedback
- Error cases not handled

### Phase 5: Classify Gaps

For each identified gap, determine:

**Gap Type**:
| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Bug | Code doesn't work as designed | Transaction fails silently |
| Feature | Functionality doesn't exist | No activity log for rebates |
| Flow | Steps are confusing or wrong order | Can't find migration button |
| Communication | Information not conveyed clearly | No explanation of what "approve" does |
| Strategy | Design decision creates friction | Too many transaction steps |

**Severity**:
| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Critical | Blocks core functionality, data loss risk |
| High | Major friction, workaround difficult |
| Medium | Noticeable friction, workaround exists |
| Low | Minor annoyance, improvement opportunity |

**JTBD Impact**:
- Which job does this gap block or impair?
- How many users affected (from canvas learning_status)?

### Phase 6: Generate Gap Report

Create report at `grimoires/crucible/gaps/{journey-id}-gaps.md`:

```yaml
---
type: gap-report
journey: "{journey-id}"
created: "{ISO-8601}"
updated: "{ISO-8601}"
total_gaps: {N}
by_severity:
  critical: {N}
  high: {N}
  medium: {N}
  low: {N}
by_type:
  bug: {N}
  feature: {N}
  flow: {N}
  communication: {N}
  strategy: {N}
linked_reality_files:
  - {reality-file}
---
```

Include sections:
1. **Summary** - Journey metadata, analysis date
2. **Gap Registry** - Individual gap entries with full details
3. **Resolution Summary** - Table of all gaps with status
4. **Recommended Actions** - Prioritized by severity

### Phase 7: Update Linked Artifacts

1. **Update Journey** - Add `gap_report` field to frontmatter
2. **Update Source Canvases** (if `--update-canvases`):
   - Add/update entries in Expectation Gap table
   - Include file:line from reality
3. **Update state.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   gaps:
     directory: grimoires/crucible/gaps/
     count: {n+1}
     last_analysis: "{timestamp}"

   journeys:
     {journey-id}:
       gap_report: grimoires/crucible/gaps/{journey-id}-gaps.md
       gap_count: {N}
   ```

---

## Gap Entry Template

```markdown
### Gap {N}: {Short Title}

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | `GAP-{journey}-{N}` |
| **Type** | {Bug / Feature / Flow / Communication / Strategy} |
| **Severity** | {Critical / High / Medium / Low} |
| **JTBD** | `[J] {label}` |
| **Step** | {journey step number} |

**User Expects**:
> {Description of user expectation}
> Source: {canvas username}, quote: "{relevant quote}"

**Code Does**:
> {Description of actual code behavior}
> Source: `{file}:{line}` — `{code snippet or description}`

**Gap**:
{Description of the discrepancy}

**Resolution**:
| Resolution Type | Description | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| {Bug/Feature/etc} | {What to do} | Pending / In Progress / Done |

**Linked Artifacts**:
- Canvas: `canvas/{username}.md`
- Reality: `reality/{component}-reality.md:{line}`
- Issue: `{TEAM-###}` (if filed)
```

|-------|------------|
| Journey not found | List available journeys, suggest creation |
| No source canvases | Prompt to add canvases to journey |
| Reality file not found | Suggest running `/ground` first |
| No gaps found | Report success, mark journey as aligned |
| Canvas parse error | Log error, continue with available canvases |
